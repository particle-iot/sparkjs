# DEPRECATED and no longer maintained. Use [particle-api-js](https://github.com/spark/particle-api-js).

`sparkjs` is deprecated. [`particle-api-js`](https://github.com/spark/particle-api-js) is the replacement library. The login form components have not been ported, but you can copy the [code](lib/spark-browser.js).

The old sparkjs documentation is [still available](old_README.md).
